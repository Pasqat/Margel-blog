                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> U.S. equity market valuations have rarely been as disconnected from economic fundamentals.
                    </li>
                    <li>Yes, the government's response is aggressive on both the monetary and fiscal policy fronts.
                    </li>
                    <li> This doesn't justify the markets' optimism, and equity market valuations are too high.</li>
                    <li>One potential index option trade on the S&P 500 could be a 5-bagger or better, though not
                        without
                        its risks.</li>
                    <li> Defensive positioning is merited in investors' portfolios.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    As U.S. equity markets have rallied back to their October 2019 levels, led largely by technology
                    companies, many are in amazement. Economic fundamentals in America are seemingly worse than
                    ever,
                    with record high unemployment and thousands of companies in dire straits from a liquidity
                    perspective after the erratic implementation of fiscal stimulus measures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My view is that equity markets remain incredibly expensive, and the risk/reward equation is
                    skewed
                    to the downside. I have implemented this view in my own portfolio by shifting largely to cash,
                    gold,
                    and long index put option positions.

                    Equity markets are only off just over 10% from their highs before the pandemic-induced market
                    chaos
                    began. Meanwhile, liquidity and bankruptcy risk for many index components has increased
                    substantially. Increased scrutiny on corporate buybacks, which has been a major driver of index
                    returns over the past decade, is also not a good thing for future returns. Of course, the U.S.
                    government has issued a quite aggressive monetary and fiscal policy response, causing some
                    market
                    analysts to speculate that investors should simply "look through" the next few quarters of
                    earnings
                    declines to the bright, sunny post-COVID world when inflation takes charge again and markets
                    return
                    to surpass their all-time highs. I'm not as optimistic.

                <p>
                    Forward earnings multiples for the top SPX index constituents have expanded significantly since
                    the
                    March market bottom. It should be noted that many of these companies - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),
                    Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), for instance
                    -
                    are technology companies that have come to be regarded as the beneficiaries of the
                    coronavirus-induced "work from home" era. I believe many of these companies do indeed have great
                    longer-term growth prospects. But the fact remains that markets are where they were in October
                    2019,
                    a point in time when equity markets were by no means cheap. In fact, compared to long-term
                    valuation
                    averages, markets were fairly expensive at this point in time. Meanwhile, the uncertainty around
                    the
                    future has risen significantly.

                    Investors are getting a second chance here to reposition their portfolios defensively. Even if
                    this
                    view proves incorrect, there is no need to risk permanent (or medium-term) capital impairment in
                    order to cure the fear of missing out on "the lows". Cash and defensive assets can always be
                    rotated
                    into the growth assets of tomorrow if and when certainty returns to the market environment
                    through a
                    resolution of the pandemic era, for instance.

                    One way investors can execute this portfolio allocation is to consider more defensive
                    allocations.
                    Of course, "defensive positioning" will vary depending on an investor's specific objectives and
                    required return on capital. However, some instruments I have found helpful in the past to
                    achieve
                    relatively more defensive positioning include consumer staples ETFs (VDC), dividend defensive
                    index
                    funds like (QDEF), and longer-term Treasury bonds (TLT).
                    One Possible Trade
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have long exposure to the 3000 strike SPX index put options with August month-end expiry.
                    These
                    currently trade at just over $200/contract, meaning if the SPX index closes below 2,800 at
                    expiry,
                    the trade is profitable. I don't intend to hold these through expiry and suffer the time decay,
                    though - giving myself the ability to profit with the inherent leverage of options even if the
                    index
                    falls from its current levels near 3,000. For instance, if the SPX index falls to near the 2,200
                    level where it bounced over the last months, this trade should yield ~5x or more (perfectly
                    timed,
                    of course). More realistically, I am viewing this trade as an interesting risk/reward and would
                    likely look to increase exposure if the market level does start to exhibit weakness.
