                    <ul>
                        <li> U.S. equity market valuations have rarely been as disconnected from economic fundamentals.
                        </li>
                        <li>Yes, the government's response is aggressive on both the monetary and fiscal policy fronts.
                        </li>
                        <li> This doesn't justify the markets' optimism, and equity market valuations are too high.</li>
                        <li>One potential index option trade on the S&P 500 could be a 5-bagger or better, though not
                            without
                            its risks.</li>
                        <li> Defensive positioning is merited in investors' portfolios.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        As U.S. equity markets have rallied back to their October 2019 levels, led largely by technology
                        companies, many are in amazement. Economic fundamentals in America are seemingly worse than
                        ever,
                        with record high unemployment and thousands of companies in dire straits from a liquidity
                        perspective after the erratic implementation of fiscal stimulus measures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My view is that equity markets remain incredibly expensive, and the risk/reward equation is
                        skewed
                        to the downside. I have implemented this view in my own portfolio by shifting largely to cash,
                        gold,
                        and long index put option positions.
                    </p>
                    <h3> ChartData by YCharts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Equity markets are only off just over 10% from their highs before the pandemic-induced market
                        chaos
                        began. Meanwhile, liquidity and bankruptcy risk for many index components has increased
                        substantially. Increased scrutiny on corporate buybacks, which has been a major driver of index
                        returns over the past decade, is also not a good thing for future returns. Of course, the U.S.
                        government has issued a quite aggressive monetary and fiscal policy response, causing some
                        market
                        analysts to speculate that investors should simply "look through" the next few quarters of
                        earnings
                        declines to the bright, sunny post-COVID world when inflation takes charge again and markets
                        return
                        to surpass their all-time highs. I'm not as optimistic.
                    </p>
                    <h3> ChartData by YCharts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Forward earnings multiples for the top SPX index constituents have expanded significantly since
                        the
                        March market bottom. It should be noted that many of these companies - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),
                        Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), for instance
                        -
                        are technology companies that have come to be regarded as the beneficiaries of the
                        coronavirus-induced "work from home" era. I believe many of these companies do indeed have great
                        longer-term growth prospects. But the fact remains that markets are where they were in October
                        2019,
                        a point in time when equity markets were by no means cheap. In fact, compared to long-term
                        valuation
                        averages, markets were fairly expensive at this point in time. Meanwhile, the uncertainty around
                        the
                        future has risen significantly.

                        Investors are getting a second chance here to reposition their portfolios defensively. Even if
                        this
                        view proves incorrect, there is no need to risk permanent (or medium-term) capital impairment in
                        order to cure the fear of missing out on "the lows". Cash and defensive assets can always be
                        rotated
                        into the growth assets of tomorrow if and when certainty returns to the market environment
                        through a
                        resolution of the pandemic era, for instance.

                        One way investors can execute this portfolio allocation is to consider more defensive
                        allocations.
                        Of course, "defensive positioning" will vary depending on an investor's specific objectives and
                        required return on capital. However, some instruments I have found helpful in the past to
                        achieve
                        relatively more defensive positioning include consumer staples ETFs (VDC), dividend defensive
                        index
                        funds like (QDEF), and longer-term Treasury bonds (TLT).
                        One Possible Trade
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have long exposure to the 3000 strike SPX index put options with August month-end expiry.
                        These
                        currently trade at just over $200/contract, meaning if the SPX index closes below 2,800 at
                        expiry,
                        the trade is profitable. I don't intend to hold these through expiry and suffer the time decay,
                        though - giving myself the ability to profit with the inherent leverage of options even if the
                        index
                        falls from its current levels near 3,000. For instance, if the SPX index falls to near the 2,200
                        level where it bounced over the last months, this trade should yield ~5x or more (perfectly
                        timed,
                        of course). More realistically, I am viewing this trade as an interesting risk/reward and would
                        likely look to increase exposure if the market level does start to exhibit weakness.
